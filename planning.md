First week: US map drawing and coloring, data sets ready and checked of:
•	Draw US map in HTML:
o	Basic script: CHECK
o	Basic HTML: CHECK
o	Basic CSS: CHECK
o	Make it work with one of below data (for one date in time): TODO
•	per state population per date and size per date; 
o	population: CHECK
o	size: CHECK
•	per state normalized costs per date;
o	Costs / size: CHECK
•	per state generated electricity based on avg. solar radiation per location per year
o	Assumption: size is kW STC (Standard Test Conditions), and a 300W solar panel has an area of 1.651* 0.9906 = 1.6354806 m2. This equals 183 W/m2.  To get the area needed for each location, the size (in kW) is divided by the wattage per m2. The generated electricity is then calculated by multiplying the area with the avg. solar radiation of each location. 
o	generated electricity per data point: CHECK
o	sum up per date: CHECK
Second week: Interaction to go from geo-view to graph-view, with ability to select or deselect certain states and to change showed data.
Third week: If first and second week have succesfully been implemented, work on optional extra's. Else work on fixing problems that were encountered in the first or second week.
Fourth week: Fine-tune, cleaning all code, cleaning up GitHub. Prepare final version.
